[Can Smallholder Extension Transform African Agriculture?](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26054)<br>
_with Joshua Deutschmann, Maya Duru and Kim Siegal_ <br>
NBER Working Paper No. 26054
<br>
Being revised
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind all
  other regions of the world. Decades of investment in agricultural research and extension have yielded more
  evidence on what fails than on what works---especially for the small-scale producers
  who dominate the sector.
  We study a program that targets multiple constraints to productivity at   once,
  similar to anti-poverty "graduation" interventions. Analyzing a randomized   controlled trial in western
  Kenya, we find that participation causes statistically and economically
  significant gains in output, yields, and profits. In our preferred
  specification, the program increases maize production by 26% and profits by
  16%. The program increases yields uniformly across the sample,
  while treatment effects on total output and profit impacts are slightly
  attenuated at the top end of the distribution.

[Media and Motivation: the Effect of Performance Pay on Writers and Content](files/BGT2020.pdf)<br>
_with Ivan Balbuzanov and Jared Gars_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study how incentives for journalists affect the quantity, quality, and composition of online
  media content. We report results from a field experiment within an online news firm in Kenya.
  Writers were randomly allocated to earn a piece-rate per article published or to a pay-per-view
  (PPV) contract. The PPV contract induced writers to produce more "popular" articles, but
  writers chose to submit fewer articles. Specifically, the PPV contract resulted in a 120% increase
  in total pageviews, a 180% increase in pageviews per article, and a 40% reduction in the number
  of articles produced. In line with our theoretical predictions, the effect on article quantity
  is concentrated among risk averse writers. Further, when given a choice, risk-averse writers
  tend to select out of the output-based contract. We also document changes along multiple
  non-incentivized dimensions of news production: writers shift away from producing local news
  towards national-level news. We see limited changes in article quality or in the prevalence of
  clickbait. Our study suggests that output-based incentive contracts have substantial implications
  for journalists' effort and content choices, and more broadly for selection into risky "gig work."

[A Group Random Coefficient Approach to Modeling Heterogeneity in Technology Adoption](files/TGBLMM2020)<br>
_with Oscar Barriga Cabanillas, Dalia Ghanem, Travis Lybbert, Jeffrey D. Michler, and Aleksander Michuda_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Our paper revisits the econometric model that Suri (2011) (S2011) used in her study of heterogeneous returns to agricultural technology adoption. We propose an alternative group random coefficient (GRC) estimation strategy and revisit the empirical puzzle of why relatively
  few sub-Saharan farmers adopt modern technologies. Drawing on recent developments in the
  nonparametric panel identification literature, we start with an unrestricted GRC model that
  nonparametrically identifies the returns to adoption under time homogeneity. We show that the
  parameters of the S2011 correlated random coefficient model (CRC) can be identified from a
  restricted version of the GRC method. Specifically, the model in S2011 implies a key restriction
  that we call linearity in comparative advantage (LCA). Our unrestricted GRC model can be
  used to detect identification concerns for key structural parameters from the CRC model. We
  illustrate our method using the same data set as the original study andnd that the motivating
  empirical puzzle remains unsolved.
